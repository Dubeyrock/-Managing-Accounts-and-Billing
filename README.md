Introduction
This project aims to automate the analysis and reporting of billing data in the healthcare industry. It uses Python for data processing, Pandas for data analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and FPDF for generating PDF reports.

Project Overview
The project workflow includes the following steps:

Data Collection and Cleaning:

Load the billing dataset.
Clean data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
Data Validation:

Validate data completeness and accuracy.
Check for anomalies such as negative amounts or inconsistent statuses.
Billing Analysis:

Calculate summary statistics (e.g., average payment amount, billing cycle times).
Visualize insights through histograms and scatter plots.
Report Generation:

Generate a detailed PDF report summarizing the findings and insights.
Include visualizations and recommendations for improving billing efficiency.
Automation:

Automate the entire process to ensure reproducibility and ease of use.
